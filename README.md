# Mission to Mars Analysis Challenge 10

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to provide Robin with a web app that they could use to boost their portfolio and hopefully land a job with NASA in the future. This task involved building an app to scrape websites for data regarding the 'Mission to Mars' and creating an HTML page to display the findings. It involved getting familiar with HTML elements, class ,and id attributes for web scraping. After getting familiar with HTML, BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to automate a web browser to perform web scraping. MongoDB was then used to store data from the web scrape into a NoSQL database. From the NoSQL database, a web application was created with Flask and used to display the formatted data. The formatting was achieved by using an HTML template in conjunction with Flask.  Please see below for the analysis deliverables. 

- Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles

- Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles

- Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
